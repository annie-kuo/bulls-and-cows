# bulls-and-cows
This program allows the user to play the old code-breaking mind game of Bulls and Cows.

# Rules of the game
- The objective is to guess a secret 4-digits number.
- When the player takes a guess, matching digits in the correct positions are called *bulls* and misplaced digits are called *cows*.
- The game reveals the number of digits that match with the secret number after each guess.
- A digit that counts as a bull does not count as a cow.
